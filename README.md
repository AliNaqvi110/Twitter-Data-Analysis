<p>The Twitter Data Dashboard is a dashboard designed in Power BI to provide insights into the performance of tweets. It features a label at the top left corner that identifies the purpose of the dashboard. Directly below the label, there is a month selector that allows users to choose a specific month to display the data.</p>

<p>Adjacent to the month selector is a column that displays a series of cards. The first card displays the total number of tweets posted during the selected month, while the second card shows the average number of impressions generated by these tweets. The third card displays the average engagement rate, which is a metric that measures the level of interaction a tweet received. Finally, the last card displays the average media engagement, which is a metric that indicates the level of interaction with any media attached to a tweet</p>

<p>To the right of the card column is an area chart column that provides a more in-depth analysis of the data. This column includes charts that display the number of tweets, average impressions, engagement rate, and media engagement by day for the selected month.</p>

<p>On the top right corner of the dashboard is a bar chart that displays the top ten tweets based on the number of clicks they received. Below the bar chart, there is a grouped bar chart that shows media views and media engagement on each day of the month. This chart provides a visual representation of the performance of media-based tweets and helps users to identify trends in media engagement over time.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the Twitter Data Dashboard provides a comprehensive view of the performance of tweets and allows users to gain valuable insights into the engagement and reach of their tweets.</p>
